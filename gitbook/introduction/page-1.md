### System

Our app will be built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Make sure that you have a running [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installation. These instructions use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), but feel free to use your preferred package manager.

### Next.js setup

Create the project repository. It will prompt for the project name, create the project folder and pull all the required depedencies for Next.js.

```bash
yarn create next --typescript
```

Enter the directory, and run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You will see the preview at `http://localhost:3000` and next will automatically build and reload the page when the source changes.
