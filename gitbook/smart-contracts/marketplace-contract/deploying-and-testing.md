# Deploying and testing

The marketplace contract can be deployed without any parameters, as it's token-agnostic:

```
ccli deploy ./contracts/market.arl
```

To create a sale, the `sell` entrypoint is called as follows (replace with the correct values):&#x20;

```
ccli call market --entry sell --arg '{"fa2_": "KT1CPHS16kLFHFi5AXNhoYjD67nwsEFr6h7o", "token_id_": 1, "amount_": 1, "price_": 1000000, "expiry_": "2023-09-01 23:00:00"}'
```

Note that the price argument is expressed in mutez, one million-th of a tez. Hence, 1\_000\_000 utez equals 1 êœ©.

Now let's switch the account and buy the NFT:&#x20;

```bash
ccli set account bob
ccli call market --entry buy --arg '{"order_id": 1, "amount_": 1}' --amount 1tz
```
