# What is TZombies?

**TZombies** is a comprehensive step-by-step tutorial on building a NFT dApp on Tezos.&#x20;

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a modern and user-friendly dApp from scratch, from smart contract development, to front-end implementation.&#x20;

The application will be based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/) for the front-end, and [Archetype](https://archetype-lang.org/)/[Completium](https://github.com/completium) for the Smart Contract development. It will be assumed that you have some basic knowledge of Typescript, React, and web development common tooling.&#x20;

The final application is deployed on the Ghostnet testnet at [https://zombies-pi.vercel.app](https://zombies-pi.vercel.app), and the repository can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/lgaroche/zombies).&#x20;
