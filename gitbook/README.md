Welcome to the **TZombies Tutorial**, a comprehensive step-by-step tutorial on building the TZombies NFT dApp on Tezos.&#x20;

You will learn how to create a modern and user-friendly dApp from scratch. The tutorial covers smart contract development and to front-end implementation.&#x20;

The application front end will be written with the [React](https://react.dev/) library and the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) development framework.The Smart Contract will be written in the [Archetype](https://archetype-lang.org/) language, with support from the [Completium](https://github.com/completium) suite of development tools.
